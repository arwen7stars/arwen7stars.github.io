# Cl√°udia Marinho - website

To do:
* Make page for each work listed on WORKS section
* For each work, make a carousel display the video and screenshots of that project, some information about it, the main languages/technologies used on it and some buttons redirecting to the source code or download links
* Removed unused code on the whole project
